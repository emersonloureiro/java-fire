Java Fire is a event framework and platform, providing:

* Publish-subscribe: publish (fire) events and have them delivered and processed by registered listeners;
* Transactionality: events are fired only within a transaction, and aren't delivered to listeners until the transaction is committed.

The latest stable release is 1.0.2.

More information on the project, including how to download it, can be found at http://jangasoft.github.io/java-fire.
